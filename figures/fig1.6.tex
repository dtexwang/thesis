	\caption[{Control of methane isotopologue abundances by reversibility and [H\textsubscript{2}] during methanogenesis}]{Preview of one of the main conclusions of \autoref{ch:2}:
		The isotopic composition of methane produced by methanogenesis is
		determined by reversibility, which in turn is related to free energy
		(for which the primary variable in most environments is H\textsubscript{2}
		concentration).}

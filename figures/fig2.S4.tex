	microbial methanogenesis from CO\textsubscript{2}]{Schematic of the model of deuterium substitution during
		microbial methanogenesis from CO\textsubscript{2}. Boxes represent
	pools of cellular carbon involved in the methanogenic pathway, and the
	asterisk represents a compound containing a deuterium substitution.
	Forward flows are represented by \emph{v}, and backwards flows are
	represented by \emph{w}. The model setup is similar in concept to
	previously published models for microbial sulfate reduction \parencite{Rees_1973_GCA,Brunner+Bernasconi_2005_GCA,Farquhar++_2007_GCA}.}

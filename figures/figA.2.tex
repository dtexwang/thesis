		Hills for A--A$'$ (\autoref{fig:A:1}). The original cross-section on which this figure
		is based was provided courtesy of The GHK Companies. Structural
		interpretation was by J. Namson and G. St.\ Clair. Reservoir sands and

		Faults are highlighted in red. Projections of studied wells onto the
		cross-section are shown in green.}

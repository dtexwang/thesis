		arbitrary set of isotopologue ratios) for CH\textsubscript{4} purified
		from the Hicks \#1 cylinder, measured on the TILDAS during a single
		sample run (\textasciitilde{}10 hours). Here, \emph{n} represents the

		cycle, samples are measured for 100 seconds, and each sample measurement
		is bracketed by measurements on the reference gas.}

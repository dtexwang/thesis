	\caption[Correction factors applied to measured number densities]{Correction factors for \autoref{eqn:C:correction}. Values were determined during 2014--2015.  Values for $D$ were derived from measurements of methane heated to equilibrium over a catalyst, and values for $H$ were derived from measurements of methane admixed with different percentages of \ce{N2} in the TILDAS cell.}
